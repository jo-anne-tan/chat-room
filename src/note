[x] 1. An area to display all the conversations sent by everyone
[x] 2. An area that lists out all the online users
[x] 3. A form that allows user to type message and press send
[x]     Note: For this chat app, username is automatically generated for each user



Form Validation:
[x] 1.    Do not allow users to submit form if there is no text input
[x] 2.    After triggering sendMessage, the existing text input should be cleared
[x] 3.    Do not allow users to type more than 500 characters. Show error message when that happens.
[o] 4.    Think about Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, etc, add any form validation that you can think of.



[x] 1. Display conversations
    Render each message nicely along with its username. Remember to handle the case when conversations is an empty array.

[x] 2. sendMessage should populate conversations state
    When sendMessage is called, get username and messages and push them into conversations array.

    Notice how the conversation window won't display the latest chat messages once it overflows? Fix that!

[x] 4. User Avatar
    Make your chat more lively by generating a profile image for each user. Adorable Avatar API is really fun and easy to use:
    Simply call https://api.adorable.io/avatars/150/${username}.png where every username will give you a different image.
    The value 150 represents 150px x 150px resolution.

Nice to haves:
[x] Highlight currentUser
[ ] Auto scroll down to latest message
